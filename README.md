### Description

This machine learning project aims to classify customers' credit scores using various regression and classification techniques. The goal is to determine which model offers the best performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency for predicting customers' creditworthiness.

### Data Set Research and Selection

The dataset used for this project was selected from [Statso](https://statso.io/credit-score-classification-case-study/). This dataset includes diverse financial and demographic characteristics of customers, enabling the evaluation of their credit scores. The key features of the dataset include:

- **Age**: The age of the individual
- **Income**: The annual income of the individual
- **Loan Amount**: The loan amount requested or borrowed
- **Credit History**: The past history of the individualâ€™s credit repayment (good or bad)
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: The ratio of debt to income, an important factor in determining creditworthiness
- **Employment Status**: Whether the individual is employed, self-employed, or unemployed
- **Other Financial Metrics**: Includes assets, monthly expenses, and other related financial information

The objective is to classify individuals into categories of creditworthiness ("Good" or "Bad") based on these attributes.

### Insights

- **Regressor vs Classifier**:
  - **Classifier models are more efficient with less tuning** compared to regressor models.
  - For binary classification tasks, classification models outperform regression models in terms of performance and simplicity.

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Achieving the highest accuracy in predictive modeling is a journey characterized by "trial and error." With each iteration, models are refined and improved, demanding patience and perseverance to discover the ideal configuration.

- **Model Selection**:
  - For tasks with clearly defined categories, classifiers are your go-to option for efficient modeling with minimal tuning effort.

### Conclusion

The results indicate that **classification models**, particularly the **Random Forest Classifier** and **KNN Classifier**, outperform regression models in terms of accuracy for credit score classification. This confirms that for classification tasks with well-defined categories, classifier models are more suitable and require less tuning to achieve good performance.
